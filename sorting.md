# Sorting

Whenever we think of data or accessing specific records, we don't consider the fact that this data must first be sorted for us to perform our operation efficiently.

In this module we will explore different sorting algorithms and evaluate their performance, code footprint, and memory consumption. There is no single best algorithm for all scenarios - some might be more appropriate in different situations than others. This section will introduce you to the topic and allow you to explore and make your own decision based on the application.

For a more comprehensive list of the different algorithms check out this [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm).


### [Bubble Sort](bubble_sort.md)

An introduction to algorithms, but otherwise a very bad sort.

### Selection Sort

Probably worse than Bubble Sort, but a good exploration of improving an algorithm.

### Insertion Sort

A good exploration of improving algorithm complexity.

### Quick Sort

As the name suggests a significant improvement over the others.

### Merge Sort

Did you see that?
